# Feature Specification: Photo Album Organizer

**Feature Branch**: `001-photo-album-organizer`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and View Photo Albums (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to create photo albums and add photos to them so that I can organize my photo collection into meaningful groups.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the application. Without the ability to create albums and add photos, the application has no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new album, adding photos to it, and viewing the photos in the album. Delivers immediate value by allowing basic photo organization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have photos available on my device, **When** I create a new album and add selected photos, **Then** the album appears on the main page with a preview of its contents
2. **Given** I have an existing album, **When** I open the album, **Then** I see all photos displayed in a tile-like grid interface
3. **Given** I am viewing an album, **When** I add more photos to it, **Then** the new photos appear in the tile grid immediately
4. **Given** I have multiple albums, **When** I view the main page, **Then** I see all albums displayed with preview thumbnails

### User Story 2 - Reorganize Albums via Drag and Drop (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to reorganize my albums by dragging and dropping them on the main page so that I can arrange them in my preferred order.

**Why this priority**: This enhances user experience by providing intuitive album management. It's not essential for MVP but significantly improves usability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating multiple albums and verifying that drag-and-drop reordering works correctly and persists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple albums on the main page, **When** I drag an album to a new position, **Then** the album moves to that position and stays there
2. **Given** I have reordered my albums, **When** I close and reopen the application, **Then** the albums appear in the order I set
3. **Given** I am dragging an album, **When** I hover over a valid drop position, **Then** I see a visual indicator showing where the album will be placed

### User Story 3 - Automatic Date-Based Album Grouping (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want my albums to be automatically grouped by date so that I can easily find albums from specific time periods.

**Why this priority**: This provides additional organizational capability that helps users manage large collections. It's valuable but not essential for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating albums with photos from different dates and verifying that automatic date grouping displays albums in chronological sections.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have albums containing photos from different dates, **When** I enable date grouping, **Then** albums are organized into chronological sections (e.g., "October 2025", "September 2025")
2. **Given** albums are grouped by date, **When** I add a new album with photos from a specific date, **Then** it appears in the correct date section
3. **Given** date grouping is enabled, **When** I drag an album to reorganize, **Then** it moves within its date group while maintaining chronological section organization

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to add photos that are already in another album? (System should allow the same photo in multiple albums)
- How does the system handle photos without date metadata? (Display in "Unknown Date" group or use file creation date)
- What happens when an album has no photos? (Display empty album with placeholder)
- How does the system handle very large albums with thousands of photos? (Implement pagination or lazy loading for performance)
- What happens when a user creates duplicate album names? (Allow duplicate names with unique identifiers)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new photo albums with custom names
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to add photos to albums by selecting files from their device
- **FR-003**: System MUST display photos within an album using a tile-based grid layout
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow the same photo to exist in multiple albums without duplication
- **FR-005**: System MUST display all albums on a main page with preview thumbnails
- **FR-006**: System MUST support drag-and-drop reordering of albums on the main page
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist album order and organization across application sessions
- **FR-008**: System MUST extract and display date information from photo metadata
- **FR-009**: System MUST group albums by date when date grouping is enabled
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent nested album structures (albums cannot contain other albums)
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to remove photos from albums
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to delete albums
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide visual feedback during drag-and-drop operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Photo**: Represents an image file with metadata including date, file path, and thumbnail preview
- **Album**: A named collection of photos with creation date, custom order, and display settings. Cannot contain other albums.
