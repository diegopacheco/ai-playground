# PhotoAlbum Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First

Code MUST be written with clarity, simplicity, and maintainability as primary goals. Every piece of code MUST:
- Be self-documenting through clear naming and structure
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and over-engineering
- Use minimal external dependencies unless clearly justified
- Be readable by developers unfamiliar with the codebase

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces bugs, accelerates development velocity, and minimizes technical debt. Code is read far more often than it is written.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TDD is MANDATORY for all feature development. The workflow MUST be:
1. Write tests FIRST based on specifications
2. Obtain user approval of test scenarios
3. Verify tests FAIL (red phase)
4. Implement minimal code to pass tests (green phase)
5. Refactor while keeping tests green

**Test coverage requirements**:
- All business logic MUST have unit tests
- All user-facing features MUST have integration tests
- All API contracts MUST have contract tests
- Edge cases and error scenarios MUST be tested

**Rationale**: TDD ensures requirements are understood before implementation, prevents regression, and serves as living documentation. The red-green-refactor cycle enforces quality at every step.

### III. User Experience Consistency

All user-facing features MUST provide consistent, predictable experiences. Requirements:
- Consistent interaction patterns across all features
- Clear, actionable error messages for all failure scenarios
- Responsive feedback for all user actions (visual or textual)
- Accessibility standards MUST be met (WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum)
- User flows MUST be validated against real user scenarios

**Data persistence**:
- User preferences MUST persist across sessions
- Application state MUST be recoverable after interruption
- Data loss scenarios MUST be explicitly prevented

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, increases user satisfaction, and decreases support burden. Users should never feel surprised or confused.

### IV. Performance Requirements

Performance is a feature, not an afterthought. All implementations MUST meet:

**Response time targets**:
- API endpoints: p95 latency < 200ms
- UI interactions: response within 100ms (perceived instant)
- Page loads: < 2 seconds on 3G connection
- Search operations: results within 500ms

**Resource constraints**:
- Memory usage: < 512MB baseline per process
- CPU usage: < 70% under normal load
- Database queries: N+1 queries prohibited, all queries < 100ms
- Bundle sizes: < 250KB initial load (gzipped)

**Scalability requirements**:
- System MUST handle 10x current load without degradation
- Horizontal scaling MUST be supported
- Database operations MUST be optimized for scale

**Rationale**: Poor performance directly impacts user retention and satisfaction. Performance requirements must be measurable and enforced.

### V. Simplicity & Maintainability

Complexity MUST be justified. Default to simplest solution that meets requirements:
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Build only what is needed now
- Avoid premature optimization
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Limit abstraction depth to 3 levels maximum
- No "clever" code: if it needs explanation, it's too complex

**Architecture simplicity**:
- Minimize number of architectural patterns
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- Dependencies MUST have clear ownership
- No circular dependencies permitted

**Rationale**: Simple systems are easier to understand, debug, maintain, and extend. Complexity should only be introduced when clear benefits outweigh costs.

## Quality Gates

All changes MUST pass these gates before merge:

**Code Quality Gates**:
- All tests pass (100% pass rate required)
- Code coverage ≥ 80% for new code
- No linting or formatting violations
- No security vulnerabilities (CRITICAL/HIGH severity)
- Performance benchmarks within acceptable thresholds

**Review Requirements**:
- All PRs require approval from at least one maintainer
- Breaking changes require design review and migration plan
- Performance-critical changes require benchmark comparison
- UI changes require UX review and accessibility validation

**Documentation Gates**:
- All public APIs MUST be documented
- All user-facing features MUST have user documentation
- All architectural decisions MUST be recorded (ADRs)
- Breaking changes MUST include migration guide

## Development Workflow

**Planning Phase**:
1. User scenarios defined and prioritized (P1, P2, P3)
2. Each scenario MUST be independently testable
3. Acceptance criteria MUST be measurable
4. Performance requirements MUST be specified

**Implementation Phase**:
1. Write tests first (TDD enforced)
2. Implement minimal solution
3. Refactor for quality
4. Validate against performance requirements
5. Update documentation

**Validation Phase**:
1. All tests pass
2. Manual testing of user scenarios
3. Performance benchmarks meet targets
4. Accessibility validation
5. Security scan clean

**Deployment Phase**:
- Incremental rollout preferred (canary → gradual → full)
- Rollback plan MUST be documented
- Monitoring and alerting MUST be in place
- Performance metrics MUST be tracked

## Governance

**Amendment Process**:
- Constitution changes require majority approval
- All amendments MUST be documented with rationale
- Version number MUST be updated per semantic versioning:
  * MAJOR: Backward incompatible changes or principle removals
  * MINOR: New principles or material expansions
  * PATCH: Clarifications, wording fixes, non-semantic changes
- All dependent templates and documentation MUST be synchronized

**Compliance**:
- All PRs and reviews MUST verify constitution compliance
- Complexity violations MUST be explicitly justified in writing
- Regular audits to ensure adherence (quarterly minimum)
- Non-compliance blocks merge until resolved

**Exceptions**:
- Emergency fixes may bypass non-critical gates with post-fix remediation required
- Technical debt MUST be tracked and addressed systematically
- All exceptions MUST be documented and reviewed

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-16 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-16
