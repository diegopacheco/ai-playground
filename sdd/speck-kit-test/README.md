# Spec Driven Development (SDD) with SpecKit Experience

I had the experience using speckit(https://github.com/github/spec-kit) and claude code using the model sonnet 4.5. 

## PROS

* It's nice that you think about design/architecture and document it.
* Speckit is cool because it works with all ai agent tools pretty much.

## CONS

* Took hours (6-8h) to just execute the "sample on the website".
* It burned tokens like crazy in claude code.
* When done, was bad, the basics was not working.
* I pretty sure If I do a "few shot" and multiple prompts with any agent I can do a much metter job.
* Generated Code sucks as well.
* Not ready for prime time.
