## Cross-Phase Integration

### Export/Import Connections (42/42)

All exports from all phases are properly imported and used:

- **Phase 1 exports**: PIECES, board functions, canvas/ctx — used by Phases 2, 3, 4
- **Phase 2 exports**: score, level, onLevelUp — used by Phases 3, 4
- **Phase 3 exports**: THEMES, currentTheme, BroadcastChannel — used by Phase 4
- **Phase 4 exports**: GameState, growBoard, resizeCanvas — integrated with all

### Critical Integrations Verified

1. **GameState Migration**: Phase 2's `isPaused` replaced with Phase 4's `GameState.PAUSED` enum
2. **Dynamic Board Height**: All collision and rendering uses `board.length` instead of static `ROWS`
3. **Theme System**: Colors flow from `themes.js` through all render functions
4. **BroadcastChannel Sync**: 7 message types all have proper handlers

### API Coverage

| Message Type | Sender | Handler | Status |
|--------------|--------|---------|--------|
| THEME_CHANGE | admin.js | main.js:367 | ✓ Wired |
| SPEED_CHANGE | admin.js | main.js:370 | ✓ Wired |
| POINTS_CHANGE | admin.js | main.js:373 | ✓ Wired |
| GROWTH_INTERVAL_CHANGE | admin.js | main.js:376 | ✓ Wired |
| STATS_REQUEST | admin.js | main.js:380 | ✓ Wired |
| STATS_RESPONSE | main.js | admin.js:50 | ✓ Wired |
| THEME_CHANGE (level up) | main.js | admin.js:70 | ✓ Wired |

## E2E Flows

### Flow 1: Full Game Loop ✓

Start → Play (10s) → Freeze (10s) → Unfreeze → Board Growth → Level Up → Theme Change → Game Over → Restart

All steps verified with code paths traced.

### Flow 2: Admin Control Loop ✓

Open Admin → Change Theme → Change Speed → Change Points → See Stats Update

Bidirectional sync verified, all message handlers present.

### Flow 3: Cross-Tab Sync ✓

Admin Change → Game Receives → Game Renders → Game Level Up → Admin Syncs

Two-way communication confirmed operational.
