# Milestone v1.0: Tetris Twist MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-03
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 12

## Overview

Browser-based Tetris game with real-time admin control loop. Admin tweaks themes, speed, and scoring while player experiences changes live. Unique mechanics include 10s freeze cycles and growing board.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Core Engine

**Goal:** Playable Tetris — pieces fall, player controls them, lines clear, game ends when stacked.
**Depends on:** None
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Canvas and board setup
- [x] 01-02: Piece definitions and input handling
- [x] 01-03: Game loop with line clearing

**Requirements:**
- CORE-01 through CORE-11 (core mechanics)
- TECH-01, TECH-02, TECH-04, TECH-05 (technical foundation)

---

### Phase 2: Scoring & Polish

**Goal:** Complete game feel — score, levels, next preview, hold, ghost, pause.
**Depends on:** Phase 1
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Sidebar with score and level display
- [x] 02-02: Ghost piece and hold mechanics
- [x] 02-03: Level progression and pause

**Requirements:**
- EHNC-01 through EHNC-04 (enhanced mechanics)
- SCOR-01 through SCOR-05 (scoring)

---

### Phase 3: Themes & Admin

**Goal:** Admin panel controls game in real-time — themes, speed, scoring all adjustable live.
**Depends on:** Phase 2
**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Theme system foundation (themes.js, board refactor)
- [x] 03-02: Theme-aware rendering (render.js refactor)
- [x] 03-03: Sync infrastructure (BroadcastChannel, theme cycling)
- [x] 03-04: Admin panel (admin.html, controls, live stats)

**Requirements:**
- THEM-01 through THEM-04 (theming)
- ADMN-01 through ADMN-07 (admin panel)
- TECH-03 (BroadcastChannel)

---

### Phase 4: Unique Mechanics

**Goal:** Implement signature mechanics — freeze cycles and growing board.
**Depends on:** Phase 3
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Freeze cycle mechanics (state machine, overlay, countdown)
- [x] 04-02: Board growth mechanics (dynamic height, canvas resize, max limit)

**Requirements:**
- UNIQ-01 through UNIQ-05 (unique mechanics)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Vanilla JS + Canvas | No dependencies constraint | ✓ Good - clean, fast |
| BroadcastChannel for sync | Native API, same-browser target | ✓ Good - instant sync |
| 3 pre-built themes | Simpler than editor | ✓ Good - sufficient |
| GameState enum over booleans | Scalable state management | ✓ Good - cleaner code |
| 7-bag randomizer | Standard Tetris fairness | ✓ Good |
| SRS wall kicks | Standard rotation system | ✓ Good |
| Store piece types in board | Enable dynamic theme changes | ✓ Good |
| Board grows at bottom | Preserves piece positions | ✓ Good |
| MAX_ROWS = 30 | 50% growth limit | ✓ Good |

**Issues Resolved:**
- Theme switching required board to store piece types not colors
- Dynamic board height required all render/collision to use board.length

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
