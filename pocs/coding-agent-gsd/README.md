I want to build a tetris game, it should have a normal and admin ui, admin should be able to change themes, time, configs of
sorts and must be applied realtime to the game. the game is tetris but every x seconds there is a 10s free, every 30s the
board gets bigger. each goog move is 10 points, 100 points you goto next level.
