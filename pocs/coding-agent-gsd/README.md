What do you want to build ? (give this prompt)
```
I want to build a tetris game, it should have a normal and admin ui, admin should be able to change themes, time, configs of
sorts and must be applied realtime to the game. the game is tetris but every x seconds there is a 10s free, every 30s the
board gets bigger. each goog move is 10 points, 100 points you goto next level.
```

## Experience Notes

* Simple
* Easy to follow
* Ask you questions, has combo for some questions.
* You can choose if work is parallel or sequential.
* GSD does Research:
```
⏺ ◆ Spawning 4 researchers in parallel...
    → Stack research
    → Features research
    → Architecture research
    → Pitfalls research
```
* replicate man SDLC but with subagents and less boring as BAMD-METHOD.
* Sucks a lot of tokens (used 5 of subscription tokens).
* After a long time
```
