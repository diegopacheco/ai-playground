#### Sigmoid

* The sigmoid function will always produce an "S" shaped curve
* and the curves will overlap when plotted over the same range. 
* However, you can shift the curves along the x-axis to avoid overlap.
* Sigmoid functions are used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity in the model. Makes the values between 0 and 1.
* The sigmoid function is defined as:
    * f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
