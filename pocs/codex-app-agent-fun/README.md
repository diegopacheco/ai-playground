# Codex App (Mac) Experience

1. Was easy to install (dmg file).
2. UI experience of the terminal interface.
3. Killer feature is that you can have multiple sessions open in tabs.
4. The app is responsive and fast.
5. It run smooth and vary fast.
6. However the code was very monolithic and hard to read. The could structure could be much better.
7. There is a bug with "space" which freezes the piece rather than send it all the way down.
