<s> [INST] What is your favourite condiment? [/INST]Well, I'm quite partial to a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It adds just the right amount of zesty flavour to whatever I'm cooking up in the kitchen!</s> [INST] Do you have mayonnaise recipes? [/INST] Absolutely! Here's a simple and classic homemade mayonnaise recipe:

Ingredients:
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 cup oil (vegetable, canola or light olive oil work best)
- 1-2 tablespoons white wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice
- Salt to taste

Instructions:
1. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the egg yolk and mustard together until they're well combined.
2. Begin to add the oil very slowly, drop by drop, while continuously whisking to emulsify the mixture. Once a small pool of oil has been incorporated, you can add it in a thin, steady stream.
3. Once the mayonnaise has thickened, you can start adding the vinegar or lemon juice. A little at a time, whisking to avoid breaking the emulsion.
4. Season with salt to taste.

Store homemade mayonnaise in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week. Enjoy your fresh and delicious mayo over sandwiches, salads, or as a dip!</s>
