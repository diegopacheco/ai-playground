Based on the title and the general context surrounding research on generative AI and its impact on mental health, especially concerning eating disorders, here’s a structured summary of the likely contents of the paper titled "From Symptoms to Systems: An Expert-Guided Approach to Understanding Risks of Generative AI for Eating Disorders."

### 1. Overview
The paper addresses the emerging risks associated with generative AI technologies in the context of eating disorders. It aims to explore how these AI systems can contribute to or exacerbate symptoms related to eating disorders while providing a framework for understanding these risks through expert insights. Given the increased integration of AI into social media and online platforms, the paper highlights the dual role of generative AI as a potential tool for both harm and healing.

### 2. Key Contributions
The main contributions of this paper likely include:
- A comprehensive framework for evaluating the risks posed by generative AI to individuals with or at risk for eating disorders.
- Insights gathered from experts in both AI and eating disorder treatment fields, providing both a technical and clinical perspective on the issue.
- Recommendations for stakeholders (e.g., AI developers, mental health professionals, policy-makers) to mitigate risks while harnessing the benefits of AI technologies.

### 3. Methodology
The approach may involve:
- A qualitative methodology where experts from relevant fields are consulted through interviews or surveys.
- The use of symptomatology and systems thinking frameworks to categorize and analyze the risks associated with generative AI.
- An interdisciplinary literature review to contextualize the findings within existing research on AI’s impact on mental health.

### 4. Results
Key findings likely include:
- Identification of specific risks associated with the use of generative AI in social media, such as increased exposure to harmful content or reinforcing negative body image standards.
- An outline of the mechanisms through which AI can influence eating disorder behaviors, including algorithm-driven content curation and the promotion of unrealistic beauty ideals.
- A discussion of protective factors and how AI could also be utilized to provide positive support for recovery from eating disorders.

### 5. Implications
The implications of the findings may have significant relevance for:
- Mental health practitioners and policymakers in understanding the nuances of how AI interacts with human behavior, especially in vulnerable populations.
- AI developers who need to consider ethical implications and the social responsibilities tied to their technologies.
- Public health initiatives aimed at fostering digital literacy and safe consumption practices among populations at risk for eating disorders, ensuring that generative AI fosters supportive environments rather than detrimental ones.

This summary reflects an overview based on common themes in research related to AI and mental health, particularly regarding eating disorders. For specific details and validated results, accessing the actual paper is necessary.
