As I don't have direct access to the content of external documents including academic papers from arXiv or any other source, I can construct a summary based on the title and my general understanding of the themes present in the area of AI ethics and ontological contexts. Here's a hypothetical summary structured according to your requested sections:

### 1. Overview
The paper titled "Enabling Ethical AI: A Case Study in Using Ontological Context for Justified Agentic AI Decisions" investigates the integration of ethical frameworks within artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It highlights how employing ontological contexts—structured representations of knowledge about the world—can help ensure that AI agents make decisions that are not only effective but also ethically justified. The case study approach illustrates practical applications of these principles in real-world scenarios.

### 2. Key Contributions
The paper makes several important contributions to the field of AI ethics:
- **Framework Development**: It proposes a novel framework that combines ontological context with ethical guidelines to influence AI decision-making processes.
- **Practical Case Study**: By providing a real-world case study, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of implementing ethical considerations in AI systems, which adds empirical evidence to theoretical discussions in the field.
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: The study integrates insights from philosophy, computer science, and ethics, paving the way for a more holistic understanding of ethical AI.

### 3. Methodology
The authors employed an empirical case study methodology to explore the proposed framework's effectiveness in guiding AI decision-making. This involved:
- **Ontological Modeling**: Developing detailed ontological models that encapsulate ethical norms relevant to the specific context of the case study.
- **Agent-based Simulation**: Using simulations to assess how well AI agents, informed by the ontological context, navigate ethical dilemmas compared to traditional decision-making approaches.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Establishing metrics to evaluate the agents' performance in terms of ethical justification and agentic behavior.

### 4. Results
Key findings from the study indicate that:
- AI systems informed by an ontological context can make decisions that align more closely with human ethical standards.
- The integration of ethical principles significantly improved the justification of agentic decisions made by AI, as measured against established ethical metrics.
- The case study demonstrated practical scenarios where the ethical frameworks directly influenced positive outcomes, suggesting that the method is viable for broader applications.

### 5. Implications
The implications of this research are manifold:
- **Policy Development**: The findings could inform policymakers and ethical committees about the necessary structures and considerations for deploying ethical AI in various sectors, such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.
- **Industry Adoption**: Technology companies may leverage the proposed framework to enhance the ethical capabilities of their AI products, potentially improving public trust in AI technologies.
- **Further Research**: The study opens avenues for future research into expanding ontological frameworks for other ethical considerations and testing their applicability across diverse AI applications.

Overall, this paper contributes significant insights into the intersection of ethics and technology, offering a structured approach to fostering responsible AI development.
