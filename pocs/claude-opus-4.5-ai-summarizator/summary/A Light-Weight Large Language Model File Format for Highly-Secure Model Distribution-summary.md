- **Security Enhancements**: The format includes methods for ensuring model integrity and confidentiality during transmission and storage.
- **Efficiency**: The paper probably discusses optimizations that allow for faster loading and processing of models, which is crucial given the significant operational demands of LLMs.

### 3. Methodology
While specific details from the paper are not available, the methodology may include:
- **Format Design**: Specification of the structure of the file format, possibly including metadata fields, model parameters, and embedded security features.
- **Security Techniques**: Implementation of cryptographic methods such as hash functions or digital signatures to provide verification of model authenticity and resistance to tampering.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Benchmarks comparing the proposed format against existing formats, demonstrating both security and efficiency improvements.

### 4. Results
Key findings from the research may include:
- **Enhanced Security Features**: Evidence that the proposed format offers improved security against common vulnerabilities associated with model distribution.
- **Performance Metrics**: Data showing the lightweight nature of the file format in terms of reduced load times, smaller file sizes, or efficient resource consumption while maintaining model performance.
