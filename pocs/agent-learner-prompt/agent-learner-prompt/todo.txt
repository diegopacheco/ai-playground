Agent Learner Prompt - Self Learning Agent

Backlog

Done
[x] Create Rust CLI project structure
[x] Implement main.rs with CLI argument parsing
[x] Create memory.txt for storing learnings
[x] Create anti-pattern.txt for bad practices to avoid
[x] Create prompt.md with version tracking (Current/Past prompts)
[x] Implement agent executor with retry loop
[x] Implement prompt versioning system
[x] Implement learning extraction from agent output
[x] Implement anti-pattern detection
[x] Run generated code in solutions/ directory
[x] Create design-doc.md
[x] Create run.sh script
[x] Create test.sh script
[x] Create build-all.sh script
[x] Create stop.sh script
[x] Update README.md with all scripts
[x] Update design-doc.md with scripts section
[x] Run 5 learning cycles per task (not just retries)
[x] Display learnings acquired each cycle
[x] Display anti-patterns identified each cycle
[x] Show cycle-by-cycle report with learnings and anti-patterns
[x] Print session summary with all learnings and anti-patterns
[x] Implement REPL mode for continuous interactive learning
[x] REPL commands: :quit, :memory, :anti, :prompts, :help, :clear
[x] Each cycle creates separate directory (cycle-1, cycle-2, etc)
[x] Improve prompt after each failed cycle
[x] Archive prompt versions with timestamps
[x] Change default cycles from 5 to 3 (faster iteration)
[x] Allow --cycles N argument to set number of cycles
[x] Allow :cycles N in REPL to change cycles dynamically
[x] Add code review phase checking: architecture, design, code quality, security, tests
[x] Filter out generic/vanilla learnings (Task completed successfully, etc)
[x] Extract specific learnings (tests passed, build succeeded, lint passed)
[x] Run solution with 10s timeout to avoid blocking on web servers
[x] Treat timeout as success for web servers (likely running)
[x] Parse review output for architecture/design/security/test issues
[x] Convert review findings to specific learnings and anti-patterns
