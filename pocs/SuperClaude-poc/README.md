## SuperClaude Experience Notes

* Used with Opus 4.5
* I asked to build a twitter like app
* It used old rust edition 2021 (should be 2024)
* It was fast, very fast. /sc:implement twitter like application with run.sh
* However monolith rust application - 1 file
* SQL and HTML and backend inside of the same file.
* Twtter like did not had login, register, or profile, just post.
