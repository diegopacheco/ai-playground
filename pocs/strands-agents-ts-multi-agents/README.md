STUDENT QUESTION: Explain what a binary search tree is and its time complexity
================================================================================

🔧 Tool #4: computer_science_assistant
✓ Tool completed
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specialized tree data structure where each node has, at most, two children. It maintains a sorted order, where the left child contains values less than its parent node, and the right child contains values greater than its parent node.

### Time Complexity:

- **Average Case** (Balanced Tree):
  - Search: \(O(\log n)\)
  - Insertion: \(O(\log n)\)
  - Deletion: \(O(\log n)\)

- **Worst Case** (Unbalanced Tree, resembling a linked list):
  - Search: \(O(n)\)
  - Insertion: \(O(n)\)
  - Deletion: \(O(n)\)

The time complexities are dependent on the tree's balance. A balanced BST ensures operations are efficient, while an unbalanced one can degenerate to resemble a linked list, leading to inefficient operations.

STUDENT QUESTION: What caused World War I?
================================================================================

🔧 Tool #5: general_assistant
✓ Tool completed
World War I was caused by a combination of factors:

1. **Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand**: The immediate trigger was the assassination of the Austro-Hungarian heir on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian Serb nationalist, which led Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia.

2. **Alliance Systems**: Europe was divided into two major alliances—the Triple Entente (France, Russia, and the UK) and the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy)—which turned the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia into a larger war involving multiple nations.

3. **Nationalism**: Intense national pride and desires for greater independence among various ethnic groups, particularly in the Balkans, fueled tensions.

4. **Imperialism**: Competition for colonies and global influence heightened rivalries among European powers.

5. **Militarism**: An arms race and the buildup of military forces, especially between Germany and Britain, made war seem inevitable as military plans significantly influenced government policies.

6. **Crisis Management Failures**: Diplomatic failures and rigid military strategies led to the rapid escalation of the conflict.

These elements collectively contributed to the outbreak of World War I, transforming a regional conflict into a global war.
