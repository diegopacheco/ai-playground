## Codebase Patterns
- Backend uses better-sqlite3 with WAL mode and foreign keys ON
- Database is initialized in db.js, called from index.js on server start
- Frontend proxies API calls to http://localhost:3001 via package.json proxy setting
- Backend tests are in backend/src/test.js using plain Node.js assertions (no framework)
- Use `npm run dev` from root to start both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 3001)
- Frontend is React + TypeScript, backend is plain Node.js + Express

## 2026-02-14 - ST-001
- Verified project setup and database schema (already implemented in prior commits)
- All 4 tables exist: users, snarks, likes, follows
- All 19 schema tests pass
- npm install, frontend build, and backend start all work correctly
- Files verified: backend/src/index.js, backend/src/db.js, backend/src/test.js, frontend/src/App.tsx, frontend/src/index.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Database file is snarktank.db in the backend directory
  - Schema uses IF NOT EXISTS so tables are safe to re-create
  - The snarks table has parent_id for replies (self-referencing FK)
  - likes table has unique constraint on (user_id, snark_id) to prevent double likes
  - follows table has unique constraint on (follower_id, following_id)
