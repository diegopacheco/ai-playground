# Experience with BMAD

1. Install from here: https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD vis `npx bmad-method install`
2. codex got the  custom commands claude code v2.1.29 did not had the bmad commands there.
3. commands and bmad and the readme differ
4. I almost feel BMAD wants to throw SAFE and call it agile on coding agents.
5. When I install globally with codex did not work when I run command to create PRD - I had to install locally on the project.
6. It's a traditional workflow
7. it ask you questiosn and drivs the show.
8. BMAD does the traditional flow, goes from PRD to UX and ask a lot of questions.
9. It tells you if you you are build is innovative or not (product level)
10. Product people might love this (PRD part at least) for engineering might be a bit boring.
11. Them it split stories, worked on acceptance criteria.
12. I type a lot of "y" and "continue" to move forward.
13. y
14. single thread - does not run all in parallel.
15. boring
16. slow - 3+ hours to build something simple.
