# Story 1.4: Scoring and Level Progression

Status: done

## Story

As a player,
I want the game to award points for good moves and advance my level over time,
so that I can track progress and feel increasing challenge.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a session is running, when I make a good move, then 10 points are added to my score, and the current score is updated.
2. When the level progression condition is met, then the level increases and is visible to the player.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement score tracking (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add 10 points on a good move
- [x] Implement level progression (AC: 2)
  - [x] Increase level when progression condition is met
- [x] Display score and level during session (AC: 1, 2)


### Review Follow-ups (AI)
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story file list does not match current git changes; documentation is stale relative to actual edits.
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story file list includes non-app artifacts (e.g. _bmad-output) which should be excluded from review scope.
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Acceptance Criteria are not explicitly mapped to tests; review cannot verify AC coverage from tests alone.
