# Story 2.3: Update Timers

Status: done

## Story

As an admin,
I want to update the timers for board expansion and forced drops,
so that I can control gameplay pacing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given I am viewing the admin configuration interface, when I change the board expansion timer or forced-drop timer, then the new timer values are saved, and the updated timing rules take effect in the game.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement timer display for board expansion and forced drop (AC: 1)
  - [x] Show active timer values in HUD
- [x] Show in-session feedback for score and level changes (AC: 1)


### Review Follow-ups (AI)
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story file list does not match current git changes; documentation is stale relative to actual edits.
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story file list includes non-app artifacts (e.g. _bmad-output) which should be excluded from review scope.
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Acceptance Criteria are not explicitly mapped to tests; review cannot verify AC coverage from tests alone.
