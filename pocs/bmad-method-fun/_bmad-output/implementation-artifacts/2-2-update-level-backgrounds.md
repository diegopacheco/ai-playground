# Story 2.2: Update Level Backgrounds

Status: done

## Story

As an admin,
I want to change level backgrounds,
so that I can adjust the visual experience of the game.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given I am viewing the admin configuration interface, when I update the level background setting, then the selected background is saved, and the game reflects the updated background setting.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement background selection control (AC: 1)
  - [x] Provide background options
- [x] Apply selected background to game view (AC: 1)


### Review Follow-ups (AI)
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story file list does not match current git changes; documentation is stale relative to actual edits.
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story file list includes non-app artifacts (e.g. _bmad-output) which should be excluded from review scope.
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Acceptance Criteria are not explicitly mapped to tests; review cannot verify AC coverage from tests alone.
