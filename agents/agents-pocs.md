# Agents POCs

## AI Agentic Mode

Agentic mode refers to the capability IDEs of plugins(like Cursor, Github copilot, and Augment Code) to act as AI agents. These plugins can autonomously write code, debug, and perform other programming tasks without direct user intervention. They utilize advanced AI models to understand the context of the codebase and make intelligent decisions.

## AI Agents

AI Agents are autonomous software programs that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with users or other systems. They leverage artificial intelligence techniques to understand and respond to user inputs, automate processes, and learn from their experiences.
