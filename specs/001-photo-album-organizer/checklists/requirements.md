# Specification Quality Checklist: Photo Album Organizer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated successfully. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the planning phase.

### Quality Assessment:

**Content Quality**: All requirements focus on user needs without technical implementation details. The spec is written in plain language suitable for business stakeholders.

**Requirement Completeness**: All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-013) are testable and specific. Success criteria include concrete metrics (e.g., "under 30 seconds", "100 milliseconds", "95% accuracy"). No clarifications needed as informed defaults were used for ambiguous areas.

**Feature Readiness**: Three prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) provide independent, testable increments. Each story has clear acceptance scenarios and can be implemented standalone.

## Notes

- Edge cases documented with reasonable default behaviors
- Photo metadata handling assumes standard EXIF data extraction
- Album organization persistence assumes local storage mechanism (implementation-agnostic)
- Specification ready for `/speckit.plan` command
