# Tasks: Photo Album Organizer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-photo-album-organizer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/database-schema.sql, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Per constitution (TDD NON-NEGOTIABLE), tests are included before implementation tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single web project: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root (photoalbum/)
- Tests use Vitest (unit) and Playwright (integration)

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Initialize Vite project with JavaScript in photoalbum/
- [X] T002 [P] Create directory structure in photoalbum/src/ (components/, services/, db/, utils/, styles/)
- [X] T003 [P] Create test directory structure in photoalbum/tests/ (unit/, integration/, fixtures/)
- [X] T004 [P] Install dependencies: sql.js, exifr in photoalbum/package.json
- [X] T005 [P] Install dev dependencies: vitest, playwright, @playwright/test in photoalbum/package.json
- [X] T006 Configure Vitest in photoalbum/vite.config.js
- [X] T007 [P] Configure Playwright in photoalbum/playwright.config.js
- [X] T008 [P] Create base HTML template in photoalbum/src/index.html
- [X] T009 [P] Create main application entry in photoalbum/src/main.js
- [X] T010 [P] Create base CSS structure in photoalbum/src/styles/main.css

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T012 Implement database schema loader in photoalbum/src/db/schema.js
- [X] T013 Create IndexedDB persistence layer in photoalbum/src/db/persistence.js
- [X] T014 [P] Implement EXIF metadata extractor in photoalbum/src/utils/exif-reader.js
- [X] T015 [P] Implement thumbnail generator using Canvas API in photoalbum/src/utils/thumbnail-generator.js
- [X] T016 [P] Implement File System Access API wrapper in photoalbum/src/utils/file-handler.js
- [X] T017 Create database access layer base in photoalbum/src/db/database.js
- [X] T018 [P] Write unit test for database initialization in photoalbum/tests/unit/db-init.test.js
- [X] T019 [P] Write unit test for EXIF reader in photoalbum/tests/unit/exif-reader.test.js

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3, 4, 5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 (AlbumGrid component)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 and US2 (AlbumGrid, drag-drop)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (T021-T030, T049-T052, T063-T066) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Database operations before services
- Services before components
- Components before UI wiring
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Database operations [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- Components marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all unit tests for User Story 1 together:
Task T021: "Contract test for Album table schema"
Task T022: "Contract test for Photo table schema"
Task T023: "Contract test for AlbumPhoto junction table"
Task T024: "Unit test for AlbumService.createAlbum()"
Task T025: "Unit test for PhotoService.addPhoto()"

# Launch database operations together (after tests fail):
Task T031: "Implement Album database operations"
Task T032: "Implement Photo database operations"

# Launch components together (after services complete):
Task T037: "Create AlbumGrid component"
Task T038: "Create AlbumCard component"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently using quickstart.md
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (can start, will integrate later)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (can start, will integrate later)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD MANDATORY**: Verify tests fail before implementing (Constitution Principle II)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
